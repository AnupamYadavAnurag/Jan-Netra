## 🧩 Problem Statement

The Delhi Government operates and funds a wide range of public initiatives including welfare schemes, infrastructure development, public procurement, healthcare programs, education subsidies, and urban development works.

Due to the scale and complexity of transactions across departments, districts, and wards, current monitoring systems face key challenges:

-  Delayed detection of irregular or abnormal spending patterns  
-  High dependency on manual verification, increasing human error  
-  Limited ability to analyze large, multi-source datasets in real time  
-  Lack of predictive insights to prevent misuse before escalation  

These challenges reduce transparency, delay corrective action, and directly impact citizens’ trust in governance.

Jan-Netra leverages **unsupervised machine learning models** and rule-based validation to detect anomalous spending and project-level inconsistencies.  
It combines financial signals, temporal patterns, and ward-level project metadata to generate **explainable risk indicators**.

-  **Citizen-facing transparency**
